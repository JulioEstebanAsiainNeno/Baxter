# Baxter

This git contains some applications for the Baxter robot, as well as the basics you should know when you work with the robot.
The basics cover arm movement, head movement, changing the screen image, camera control and the collection of data like angles and positions.

Each file has comments explaining in a brief way how the apllication works. They also have the corresponding run instructions.
